##[WEB SERVICES](http://www.zkoss.org/product/zk)

> A Web service is a method of communications between two electronic devices over the World Wide Web. It is a software function provided at a network address over the web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing.

> The W3C defines a Web service as:

>     a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). Other systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards.[1]


> ZK is renowned for its "Ajax without JavaScript" approach since 2005,
> enabling developers to build rich internet applications transparently
> without any knowledge of Ajax and JavaScript.

> The client engine and update engine in ZK play the roles of pitcher and
> catcher, rendering Ajax communication transparent to developers. Events
> triggered by users are encapsulated and marshalled to event listeners
> running at the server.

> User interface rendered on browsers are surrogated on the server as
> POJO components, alternation made on the POJO components are reflected
> to the client transparently.

> With programs executed at the server, developers can leverage all the Java
> technologies, such as Java EE and Spring, while back-end data and services
> are readily available.
